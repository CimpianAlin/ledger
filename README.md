# Brave Ledger
The Brave Ledger is a BTC-based micropayments system for users and publishers.

Note that [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/brave/ledger) is not yet operational for this repository.

# Initialization
Take a look at the files in the `config/` directory.
When the server starts,
it will look file a file called `config/config.{PROFILE}.js` where `{PROFILE}` is `$NODE_ENV` (defaulting to `"development"`).

Authentication is achieved via a GitHub [OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/developers).
Create a developer application with an authorization callback of the form `https://{DOMAIN:PORT}/v1/login` and update the
`login.clientId` and `login.clientSecret` properties.

Authorization is achieved by verifying that the user is a member of a GitHub organization, i.e.,
`https://github.com/orgs/{ORGANIZATION}/teams`.
Set the `login.organization` property to the name of the organization.

Now start the server with `npm start` and `https://{DOMAIN:PORT}/v1/login` which will start the authentication/authorization
process.
On success,
you will be redirected to `https://{DOMAIN:PORT}/documentation`.

When the server starts,
it will create (if necessary) a `persona` and a `wallet` registrar.
You will need to create a 'contribution' surveyor,
go to `https://{DOMAIN:PORT}/documentation#!/v1/postV1SurveyorSurveyortype`,
set`surveyorType` to 'contribution',
and enter a body like this:

    { "adFree": { "fee": { "USD": 5.00 }, "votes": 30 } }

## StandardJS

For linting we use [StandardJS](https://github.com/feross/standard). It's recommended that you install the necessary IDE plugin. Since this repo uses ES7 features, you'll need a global install of both the standard and babel-eslint packages.

## Configuration

For staging or production environments configuration variables are stored as environment preferences. See config/config.production.js for a list of these variables.

For local development you can copy config/config.development.js.tpl to config/config.development.js and define the local config variables.

## Running the server

Use `gulp` to run the server in development. This also sets up watchers and will restart the server on a file change.

## Proximo

Proximo is currently used as a proxy so we can make outbound BitGo requests using a static IP. 
Please define `process.env.BITGO_USE_PROXY` as appropriate.
